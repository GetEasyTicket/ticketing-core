Core system to view and book tickets

For checkstyle

Your XML file is too new (latest unreleased Checkstyle). Do not download the Google checks XML, instead check them in the list shown in your screenshot (put a checkmark next to "Google Checks").

If you really must download, then use the matching version of the config, e.g.
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/checkstyle-8.16/src/main/resources/google_checks.xml
